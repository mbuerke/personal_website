abstract: "The study of suicide is complex and often relies on proxy measures of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which have significant limitations. Virtual Reality (VR) has recently been used to study processes associated with suicidal behavior without the associated risk. However, other mechanisms may explain the decision to engage in virtual suicide, other than suicide-related processes. One such confounder, impulsivity, may impact this decision as it relates to other safe recreational jumping activities (e.g., base jumping, bungee jumping, skydiving). This study examined likelihood of jumping (“Virtual Suicide”) in a VR suicide scenario in a sample of 145 undergraduates. Specifically, we examined impulsivity facets, suicidal ideation, and history of suicide attempt to determine which factors predicted jumping likelihood. We found that suicidal ideation and only the impulsivity facet of sensation-seeking were related to the likelihood that someone jumped during the VR suicide scenario, while history of suicide attempt was not. More research needs to be done on using suicide-related VR to better understand its relationship with real life suicidal behavior, however it has promise for the future of suicide research after further study."
