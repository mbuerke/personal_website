abstract: "<strong>Background: </strong>
Thought processes such as worries are often described as difficult to control and predict suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Due to their uncontrollable nature, worries may lead to STBs as people attempt to escape their own internal thought processes.<br>

<strong>Objective: </strong>
Examine the indirect role of perceived uncontrollability of one’s thoughts in the relationship between worry and STBs.<br>

<strong>Design and Method: </strong>
We used stepwise mediation models to examine the proposed relationship in a sample of 145 undergraduates with lifetime suicidal ideation. STBs were categorized into (1) severity of lifetime suicidal ideation, (2) likelihood and (3) severity of recent suicidal ideation, and (4) lifetime suicide attempt. The likelihood and severity of recent ideation were separated due to the skewed nature of suicidal thoughts, with many people reporting zero ideation.<br>

<strong>Results: </strong>
Worry was related to the severity of lifetime ideation, the likelihood of reporting recent ideation, and the severity of recent ideation through lower levels of perceived ability to control one’s thoughts. Worry was not related to a lifetime suicide attempt.<br>

<strong>Conclusion: </strong>
The perception that one’s thoughts are uncontrollable may be a core feature of worry for the development and worsening of suicidal thinking. Interventions targeting internal perceptions of uncontrollability may be beneficial for suicidal ideation management."
